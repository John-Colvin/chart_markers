# Chart Markers
 
Charts in financial markets are a mess: $ or &euro; or &pound; or &yen; might be represented by different symbols on different charts. 
Indeed, sometimes different symbols in charts created by the same author and appearing on the same page.

A consistent set of markers would allow readers to focus more on the meaning of the data, and less on the distraction of attempting to decode the markers. 
Such a set of markers has been made, showcased on this page.

If you and you alone use it, then you would be consistent for your readers: a good thing. 
If others also use it, it would be even easier for your readers: even better.

Start by marvelling at 
[gallery](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Gallery.md), then read the 
[description](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Description.md). There is technical comment about the SVG 
[code](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Code.md). Unhappy: before gumbling, read about good and bad 
[grumbles](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Grumbles.md). And finally, an explanation of the 
[Files](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Files.md).
